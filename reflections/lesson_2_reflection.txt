Repository is needed for storing the files I am working on.
An empty repository with 0 commits is created.
Files in the directory are untracked.
$  git init

$git log  
   shows all the commits and will be empty with NO HEAD message

$ git status
   will show the unrtracked files
   and no files be tracked as we have only initilaized the rtepository.

Staging area is where a group of file sthat are to be logically comitted grouped in.

A commit will move this files from the staging area to the repository.

$ git diff
    compares working with staging
$ git diff --staged
    compares working with files in  staging
$ git diff commit1 commit2
    compares two commits in repository

To head  from and old commit
    $ git checout master

 How can you use staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add relevant changes for the logical change into staging area and then do a git commit.

Branches are good to do 1) experimental stuff 2) A work area for different lnguage . I can alsway go back to the main branch when I have to do a demo.  Also later I can merge from a branch to the main branch.
